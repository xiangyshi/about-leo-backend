# about-leo-backend

Backend service for about-leo-ai, powering the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that answers user questions based on my personal projects, experiences, and documents.

This service handles document ingestion, embedding, similarity search, and integration with an LLM to generate context-aware responses.
